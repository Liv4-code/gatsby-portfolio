    This multi-step input form is used to gather detailed data about a
    building's water use infrastructure. The data retrieved in this tool is used
    to calculate water usage cost savings and thereafter is compiled into a
    report that's sent to the user upon completion of the audit.

    that uses IoT device data to determine whether a device is offline or not.
    All these offline devices get compiled into a coherent report.
