## A Bit About Me

> At present, I mostly work with Javascript and use Vue.js as my framework of choice. My development involves creating UI's that display data in a way that's pleasing and relevant to the end user.
> I would love to collaborate, read code that isn't my own, and accumulate invaluable knowledge working under and alongside other developers in my team.
> I take pride in my work and since the name of the game is lifelong learning, I'm sure to do just that in order to deliver products that exceed end user expectations.
> I'm currently learning Node.js and state management with Redux and see myself growing into a full-stack web based developer.
